# Host Crash Guard

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that stops Resonite from crashing when the host crashes. Instead, a small warning notifies you of what happened, and lets *you* decide when to close the world.

This mod now supports a small collection of crash fixes, as follows
- ValueMod\<Decimal\> crash [#2746](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/2746)
- Host Timeout crash [#2681](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/2681)
- Invalid Component crash [#1646](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/1646)

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
1. Place [HostCrashGuard.dll](https://github.com/AwesomeTornado/Resonite-HostCrashGuard/releases/latest/download/HostCrashGuard.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
